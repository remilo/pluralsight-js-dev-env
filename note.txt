use node security platform to check for security issue in the package
to check for a package, run nsp check in the project folder

to share the work we will use localtunnel
then start your application localy as usual
sudo node buildScripts/srcServer.js
then open a second terminal and run
lt --port 3000
pick the adress and that's it
to customize the adress and subdomain run
lt --port 3000 --subdomain remi

transpilling will be done with Babel. We will write ES6 code.
But maybe some platform do not have ES6 but ES5.
Therefore we will transpille ES6 to ES5 with Babel

for bundling we will use webpack
to debug we will use sourcemaps
