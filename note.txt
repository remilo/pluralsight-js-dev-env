use node security platform to check for security issue in the package
to check for a package, run nsp check in the project folder

to share the work we will use localtunnel
then start your application localy as usual
sudo node buildScripts/srcServer.js
then open a second terminal and run
lt --port 3000
pick the adress and that's it
to customize the adress and subdomain run
lt --port 3000 --subdomain remi

transpilling will be done with Babel. We will write ES6 code.
But maybe some platform do not have ES6 but ES5.
Therefore we will transpille ES6 to ES5 with Babel

for bundling we will use webpack
to debug we will use sourcemaps

for linting we will use ESlint
to run it always, do npm
run lint -- --watch
and let it run in the console to have a live watching each time you save a file
or type npm start
or npm start -s (for simplified output)

for testing we will use mocha
we will use chai for assertion library
for continuous integration server we will use Travis and Appveyor
